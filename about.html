<h1>About Me</h1>
<h4>Hello World!</h4>
<p>My name is Manuel and I work as a behavior therapist, currently honing my skills to transition into the field of web development. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, staying active through workouts, and embarking on Pokemon-hunting adventures with my girlfriend. Drawing is another one of my creative outlets. Ultimately, my primary life goal is to ensure the well-being of my loved ones by being able to provide for and protect them.</p>
